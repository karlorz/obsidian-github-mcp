# Obsidian GitHub MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to GitHub repositories containing Obsidian vaults. This server enables seamless integration with your knowledge base stored on GitHub, allowing AI assistants to read, search, and analyze your Obsidian notes and documentation.

## Why This Tool?

Many Obsidian users store their vaults in GitHub for backup, versioning, and collaboration. This MCP server bridges the gap between your GitHub-hosted Obsidian vault and AI assistants, enabling:

- **Knowledge Base Access**: Retrieve specific notes and documents from your Obsidian vault
- **Intelligent Search**: Find relevant content across your entire knowledge base
- **Evolution Tracking**: See how your ideas and notes have developed over time
- **Task Integration**: Connect with issues and project management workflows

## Features

- **GitHub Repository Access**: Connect to any GitHub repository containing your Obsidian vault
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Written in TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions
- **Input Validation**: Robust validation for all API inputs using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative messages
- **MCP Integration**: Full compatibility with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and other MCP hosts

## Available Tools

### Knowledge Base Access

- **getFileContents**: Retrieve the contents of specific notes, documents, or files from your Obsidian vault
- **searchFiles**: Enhanced search with multiple modes:
  - `filename`: Find files by exact filename (perfect for "OKR 2025" type searches)
  - `path`: Search anywhere in file paths 
  - `content`: Search within file contents
  - `all`: Comprehensive search across filenames, paths, and content

### Project Management Integration

- **searchIssues**: Search for issues and discussions related to your knowledge base projects
- **getCommitHistory**: Track how your knowledge base has evolved over time with detailed commit history and diffs

## Use Cases

### For Knowledge Workers
- **Research Assistant**: AI can access your research notes and reference materials
- **Writing Support**: Pull relevant background information from your knowledge base
- **Idea Development**: Track how concepts have evolved across your notes

### For Developers
- **Documentation Access**: Retrieve project documentation and technical notes
- **Learning Journals**: Access your learning notes and code examples
- **Project Planning**: Integrate with GitHub issues for comprehensive project management

### For Students & Academics
- **Study Materials**: Access lecture notes and study guides
- **Research Papers**: Retrieve research notes and citations
- **Collaboration**: Work with shared knowledge bases stored in GitHub

# For Cursor
npx -y @smithery/cli install @karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp --client cursor

# For Windsurf
npx -y @smithery/cli install @karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp --client windsurf

# For Cline
npx -y @smithery/cli install @karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp --client cline
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
npm install @karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp
```

## Configuration

Add the server to your MCP settings file with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidianGithub": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token",
        "GITHUB_OWNER": "your-github-username",
        "GITHUB_REPO": "your-obsidian-vault-repo"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token ([create one here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
- `GITHUB_OWNER`: The owner/organization of the GitHub repository
- `GITHUB_REPO`: The name of the repository containing your Obsidian vault

### GitHub Token Permissions

Your GitHub token needs the following permissions:
- `repo` (for private repositories) or `public_repo` (for public repositories)
- `read:org` (if accessing organization repositories)

## Example Workflows

### Accessing Your Daily Notes

```json
{
  "tool": "getFileContents",
  "arguments": {
    "filePath": "Daily Notes/2024-01-15.md"
  }
}
```

### Finding Files by Name (Perfect for "OKR 2025" example!)

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "OKR 2025",
    "searchIn": "filename"
  }
}
```

### Finding Files by Path

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "Daily Notes",
    "searchIn": "path"
  }
}
```

### Finding Research on a Topic (Content Search)

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "machine learning algorithms",
    "searchIn": "content",
    "perPage": 10
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Search (Filename, Path, and Content)

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "project planning",
    "searchIn": "all"
  }
}
```

### Advanced GitHub Search Syntax

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "path:*.md extension:md",
    "searchIn": "content"
  }
}
```

### Tracking Knowledge Evolution

```json
{
  "tool": "getCommitHistory",
  "arguments": {
    "days": 30,
    "includeDiffs": true,
    "maxCommits": 10
  }
}
```

## Search Tips & Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Your File by Name?

**Problem**: Searching for "OKR 2025" doesn't find your file named "OKR 2025.md"

**Solution**: Use the `searchIn: "filename"` parameter:

```json
{
  "tool": "searchFiles",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "OKR 2025",
    "searchIn": "filename"
  }
}
```

### Advanced Search Techniques

1. **Exact Phrases**: Use quotes for multi-word searches
   ```json
   {
     "query": "\"project planning 2025\"",
     "searchIn": "content"
   }
   ```

2. **File Extensions**: Find specific file types
   ```json
   {
     "query": "path:*.md",
     "searchIn": "content"
   }
   ```

3. **Directory Specific**: Search within folders
   ```json
   {
     "query": "path:\"Daily Notes/\"",
     "searchIn": "content"
   }
   ```

## Migration from mcp-private-github-search

If you're migrating from the older `mcp-private-github-search` package:

1. Update your package name in configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidianGithub": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@karlorz/obsidian-github-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. The functionality remains the same - all existing tools work identically
3. Consider the new Obsidian-focused use cases and workflows
